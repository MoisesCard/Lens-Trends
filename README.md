# User Story 

As a user I want to be able to view photos based on my interest.

I want to be able to categorize them myself.

So that I can view them in like groups.


Given I am an artist

When I open the application 

Then I can choose the categories of photos I would like to see.

When I select a specific photo 

Then I am presented with the option to save it in my favorites or a folder I can categorize 

When I click on a specific category 

Then I can view the photos I saved there.
